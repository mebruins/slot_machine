This slot machine was one of my early projects in taking the NuCamp class. 

Users start with adding to their account, then can place their bet on the slots. The program then random selects three icons from the list created.
Your winnings are based on the number of matches made. A pair returns double your bet, and three of a kind returns triple your bet. 
You can leave the game at any time, but if you run out of tokens then the game is over.
